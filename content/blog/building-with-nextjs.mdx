# Building with Next.js 15 and App Router

The Next.js App Router represents a significant shift in how we build React applications. Here's what I learned building this portfolio.

## Why Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 brings several improvements:

1. **Better Performance**: Turbopack for faster builds
2. **React 19**: Latest React features including Server Components
3. **Improved Caching**: More control over caching strategies
4. **Better DX**: Improved error messages and debugging

## The App Router Advantage

The App Router provides:

- **Server Components by default**: Better performance and SEO
- **Nested Layouts**: Shared UI that doesn't re-render
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading.tsx for better UX
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with error.tsx

## Performance Considerations

Building a 3D hero scene while maintaining performance required:

- Dynamic imports for Three.js components
- Reduced device pixel ratio on mobile
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Optimized images with next/image

## Code Organization

I structured the project with:

```
/app          - Routes and pages
/components   - Reusable UI components
/lib          - Utilities and helpers
/content      - MDX blog posts and config
```

This separation keeps the codebase maintainable as it grows.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Server Components are powerful**: Default to server components, opt into client components only when needed
2. **Type safety matters**: TypeScript catches bugs before they reach production
3. **Performance is a feature**: Users notice smooth animations and fast load times
4. **Accessibility is essential**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support from day one

Building modern web applications is exciting, and Next.js 15 makes it easier than ever.
