        {
          "q": "What is the authenticity paradox?",
          "a": "Research shows that to appear 'authentic' online, you must share vulnerable or negative experiences - but doing so has social costs. The very act of presenting authenticity becomes a performance, making true authenticity either unreachable or only possible at great personal cost."
        },
        {
          "q": "Why do I feel behind when I see others' success on social media?",
          "a": "Social comparison on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter triggers anxiety because you're comparing your full internal experience (doubts, struggles, mundane days) to others' curated highlights. Studies show this is universal - even successful people feel it."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is it bad to check metrics like GitHub stars or LinkedIn views?",
          "a": "Not inherently, but when metrics 'decide your mood' daily, it becomes problematic. The feedback loop of external validation can disconnect you from internal values and make your self-worth contingent on numbers you can't fully control."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can you be authentic online while maintaining a professional presence?",
          "a": "Partially. You can be selectively authentic - sharing real experiences without sharing everything. But full authenticity requires vulnerability that most professional contexts punish. The key is being aware of what you're choosing to show and why."
